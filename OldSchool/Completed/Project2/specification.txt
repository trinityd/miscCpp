Registration Book
Version 1.0

SPECIFICATION
 

OVERVIEW

A registration book for a soccer club whose entries consist of a name, 
year of birth, league category, and registration status.  
The user can erase all players and start a new season, write all players
 in a category to a file, search for an entry, and add or edit entries. 
Changes made are saved when the program quits.


DETAILS

The Registration Book displays a single entry, which consists of a 
name, a year of birth, a league category, and a registration status on separate lines.  
Below the entry, a menu of commands is displayed.  Below that menu, the prompt 
"command:" is displayed.  The user types the first letter of a 
command, the command executes and the appropriate entry is 
displayed.  Some commands prompt the user for more information.  

The entries are displayed in alphabetical order.  No entry is 
displayed if the Registration book is empty.
