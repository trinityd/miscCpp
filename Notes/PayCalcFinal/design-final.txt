Pay calculator
Version 1

DESIGN -- FINAL


  o const double kPayRate = 12;
    

  o int main()

    Runs the calculator.  See program spec for details.

    Implementation note: Uses Time to store times and delegates the time operations to the associated functions.


  o Time
  
    A structure that represents a time as two integers, hours and minutes.  Times are on a 24-hour clock (0:00 to 23:59).
    
    Operations:
    
        void initialize(Time & t)
            Sets t to 99:99.
            
        void read(Time & t, istream & in)
            Reads t from in the format h:mm or hh:mm, where each h and m stands for a single digit.  No error-checking.
            
        void print(const Time & t, ostream & out) 
            Prints t to out in the format described for read.
        
        double difference(const Time & t1, const Time & t2)
            Computes the difference, in hours, between t1 and t2.  The difference is positive if t1 occurs after t2.  In other words, the difference is computed as "t1 - t2".
